* About Brewfile
 1. Apps registered in Homebrew are "brew 'app-name'" (installed with the brew install command)
 2. Apps not registered in Homebrew are "tap 'app-name'" (installed with the brew tap command)
 3. Normal apps are "cask 'app-name'" (those installed using Homebrew Cask)
 4. Apps installed from AppStore are "mas 'app name' id:XX"
 'brew cask' can be used if you install Homebrew, but 'mas' requires 'mas-cli' to be installed.
 Brewfile can be generated by command 'brew bundle dump' and overwritten by '--force' option.
